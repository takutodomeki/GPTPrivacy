# GPTPrivacy
This GPT helps users discover U.S. Congressional bills that may relate to their personal life circumstances. To do so, it processes natural language inputs and extracts keywords to search public government databases, such as Congress.gov.

What We Collect

We do not collect or permanently store any personal information. However, your input is temporarily processed to extract relevant topics (e.g., veteran status, housing concerns) in order to find matching legislation.

Third-Party APIs

This GPT uses the Congress.gov public API to search for bills and display relevant information, including sponsor details and links to external legislative resources. No personal data is sent to Congress.gov — only topic-based search queries.

Data Handling

Your data is not stored, sold, or shared outside the scope of this GPT session.

OpenAI may log interactions for safety, research, and quality purposes as described in its own privacy policy

No user profiles, cookies, or tracking tools are used by this GPT.

Usage Guidance

Please avoid sharing personally identifiable information (e.g., full names, addresses, phone numbers). You can describe your situation in general terms (e.g., "I'm a student" or "I'm a veteran").
